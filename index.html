Southeast of the island of Palawan, within the Sulu Sea, lies one of the best marine reserves and dive sites in the world; the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park. A sprawling system of coral reefs (containing about half of the world’s coral species) that is home to an extensive variety of fish, sharks, dolphins, and whale species, the Tubbataha Reefs is one of the most sought-after waters for divers on the planet.   </p>

  <h2>Vigan - Ilocos Sur</h2>
  <p>
    Vigan is a place where time stands still. It is the best-preserved example of a planned Spanish colonial town in Asia. Established in the 16th century, Vigan’s architecture reflects the coming together of cultural elements from elsewhere in the Philippines, from China and from Europe, resulting in a culture and townscape that have no parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia that’s why it is the most beautiful tourist spot in the Philippines. No wonder Vigan has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
